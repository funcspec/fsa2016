This repository contains code files that you can copy, edit
and then submit in your own repository.

To get a repository, please send an e-mail to malvin@w4eg.eu
and tell me with whom you are working together. It is up to
you whether you want to work on the lab exercises alone or in
pairs. If you choose to work in pairs you should still make
sure you acquire individual skills.
