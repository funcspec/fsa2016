# Functional Specification of Algorithms 2016

For more information, see the course website at
<http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/courses/16/fsa/>.

This repository contains code files that you can copy, edit
and then submit in your own repository.

To get a repository, please send an e-mail to malvin@w4eg.eu
and tell me with whom you are working together. It is up to
you whether you want to work on the lab exercises alone or in
pairs. If you choose to work in pairs you should still make
sure you acquire individual skills.

*Note*: You can now also read the repositories of all other
students. This is to facilitate the discussion among each
other and to allow you to look at different solutions for
the past homework.
Of course we still expect you to solve the problems on
your own and not to copy code from someone else.
