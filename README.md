# Functional Specification of Algorithms 2016

For more information, see the course website at
<http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/courses/16/fsa/>.

This repository contains code files that you can copy, edit
and then submit in your own repository.

To get a repository, please send an e-mail to malvin@w4eg.eu
and tell me with whom you are working together. It is up to
you whether you want to work on the lab exercises alone or in
pairs. If you choose to work in pairs you should still make
sure you acquire individual skills.

## Private Repositories

~~*Note*: You can also read the repositories of all other
students. This is to facilitate the discussion among each
other and to allow you to look at different solutions for
the past homework.
Of course we still expect you to solve the problems on
your own and not to copy code from someone else.~~

*New Note*: Repositories are now again only visible for the
respective team members. This is because they will also contain
your grades and to prevent you from getting too lazy and
stealing too much from others.
You can still ask other people how they are implementing the
current exercises of course. But it should be up to each of
you how much you want to share or work on your own.

If now we see something great in somebody's homework and want
to show it to others we will copy the relevant parts into this
repository here or include it in the Friday notes.
